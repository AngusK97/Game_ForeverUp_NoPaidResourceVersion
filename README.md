# Game_ForeverUp_NoPaidResourceVersion
My 2024 Tuanjie(Unity) Game Jam demo removed paid resources. It is made on my Minimal Unity Game Framework, so it's also a demo how the framework works. You can modify on this project as you like, and I hope it can be helpful to you :)

# Resources
All paid resources are removed, including:
- player models
- item models
- environment object models in special scene
- *[Make You A Sunset](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=2656633270)*, the background music in special scene
All the models mentioned are from Synty Studios, and all animations are from Miamo.

# Environment
Tuanjie Engine Version: 1.3.4
By the way, Tuanjie Engine is just a Chinese-version Unity, you may also be able to launch this project with Unity above 2022 LTS version.

# Minimal Unity Game Framework
If you are interested in making games as well, you can learn about my MinimalUnityGameFramework [here](https://github.com/AngusK97/MinimalUnityGameFramework.git). Hope it can make your game development easier~
